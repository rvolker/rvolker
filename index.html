        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Paddles up! Chey Martineau pulled a permit for a private river trip on the <em>"Wild" Main Salmon!</em> We'll be launching <em>Wednesday June 22, 2022</em> from <em>Corn Creek, Idaho</em>.
        At a glance, here are some facts:</p>

        </div>

        <ul class="glance">
            <li><strong><em>The Main Salmon</em></strong> is the lower section of the Salmon River, below the infamous Middle Fork on the Salmon River which is historically known as <em>The River of No Return</em>.
                This wild river makes its way through the second deepest gorge on the continent; only Hells Canyon on the Snake River is deeper. 
                The Salmon's granite-walled canyon is over 1,000 feet deeper than the Grand Canyon. For approximately 180 miles, the Salmon River canyon 
                is more than a mile deep. Another fun fact, the river gradiant is steeper than the Colorado river in the Grand Canyon.</li>
            <li><strong>What about permits?</strong> Chey Martineau pulled a permit her very first year in the river lottery.</li>
            <li><strong>Rapid rating</strong> III-IV. We can expect early season snow melt run off.</li>
            <li><strong>Will there be Tiki Torches?</strong> Why yes, or a maybe, we need to work on Chuck.</li>
            <li><strong>What do I need to bring?</strong> More details below.</li>

        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        <p><strong>5 rafts, 1 cataraft, 1 kayak, 2 standup paddle boards, and 1 duckie</strong> to carry all 18 of us downstream 80 miles to Carrey Creek.
            There will be enough rapids to making this a very exciting trip. The gradient of this river is steep, so it's all downhill towards the Pacific -it's gonna be fast!
            Even at normal flows this section of River is moving quickly, which awlays surprises every boater. There's no flat water, no rowing hell like Deso.
        <p><strong>Private Trip.</strong>  This is a self guided private trip, which means that we get to do everything.  Yep that's right, everything, and we mean everything.
            Sure we do everything, and that's what makes a private trip so great. There will be a lots to do every day after the thrills and spills on the river. With the fast river flow 
            there'll be plenty of time to relax or go for hikes. Then the very next day we'll break down camp, load and rig the boats. Rigging the boats can take a bit of time, 
            but once we've pushed off life is so good. There will be some pucker-factor moments. Scouting the major rapids, knowing that there's only one way to go no matter what.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Shared meals.</strong>  This is an opportunity to show off your best camp cooking skills. Please keep in mind that this group on previous trips has set the bar high. 
            So do your best and impress us. Give us your best outdoor river cooking.</p>
        <p><strong>River.</strong> The water flow is <strong>not</strong> controlled so water level will fluctuate according to the dictates of nature.
            We've been watching the predictions, snow pack is below normal and the expected flow is normal or below, which means a green-light, so the trip is a go.
            The water temperature will be cold to cool, this afterall early June, so please plan accordingly.
        <p><strong>Bugs.</strong> Generally not a problem on this section of river due to flow water.  However, be prepared for a mosquito hatch just in case.
        <p><strong>Climate.</strong> Daytime temperatures highs could be in the 70's or 80's with lots of sun and lows in the 40's or 50's. 
            However, typically <strong>many early June trips experience highs in the 50's with rain and lows in the 30's.</strong> Yes, it could even snow, but we don't expect freezing temparatures.
        Based on historical averages, the daytime high temps could be 70-80&#176; (78&#176; mean) with nighttime lows somewhere in the 40-50&#176; (46&#176; mean).
        When on the river there could be full exposure to the sun, so it could be hot or cold.
        All things considered, the experts tell us that this is a great time of year to be on the river!

       <p>Some highlights include:</p>
       <ul>
           <li><strong>Be Prepared.</strong> This is a river trip into the rugged wilderness. Backcountry travelers must be prepared for varying,
               unpredictable weather conditions and should be aware of potential dangers in this environment.</li>
           <li>All garbage, both organic and inorganic, will be carried out.</li>
           <li>Groovers (toilets) are provided by our group at each campsite. Backcountry regulations require that human waste and toilet paper
               be packed out of the backcountry. In short, we'll all share in the duties of taking care of this nasty little necessity.</li>
           <li>Respect for cultural sites. All natural objects and cultural artifacts are protected and must be left where they're found.</li>

        <h4><strong>Pro Tips</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Since weather conditions can be unpredictable, a small day-use dry bag to carry rain gear or suns gear that you may need on the river during the day.</li>
            <li>Pack light! Dirty on the river is quite fashionable, and be sides that you don't have to haul extra stuff around.</li>
            <li>Small soft duffel bag to transport all your shiz to the put-in. From there you'll stuff the contents from your duffel into your river dry bag.</li>
            <li>Sun glasses, and of course croakies, chums, something to keep them from floating away.</li>
            <li>Pillow, small camp pillow stuffed at the bottom of your dry bag.</li>  
            <li>Plastic bags. (There will some available at Friday night's camp). Garbage sized for wet clothes in dry bag, and several ziplock freezer size.</li>
            <li>Clothing for the car ride. Left in the car at the put-in, so after getting off the river you'll have something a little fresher to wear for the long ride home.</li>

        <p> Both suggest a duffel bag. This is for transporting your personal gear to the put-in, and then into your dry bag it goes.</p>

           <li><strong>Chuck Schamel</strong> has graciously volunteered to be our coffee supplier and brew master. By the way, this is by popular demand too. Thank you Chuck!</li>

            <p>	We'll be traveling with a Garmin inReach Satellite communicator which provides two-way text messaging.
                Primary & secondary contacts have been arranged, and will be automatically alerted when necessary.
                </p>
            <p>	In the event of an emergency messages can be sent to us while we're on the river.  These messages would go through
                our emergency primary & secondary contacts who then can send the messages:</p>
