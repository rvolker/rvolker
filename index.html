        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This long awaited private river trip on the <em>Main Fork of the Slamon</em> will be pushing off <em>Saturday June 12, 2021</em> from <em>Corn Creek, Idaho</em>.  
            Here are some facts about the trip at a glance:</p>

        </div>

        <ul class="glance">
            <li><strong><em>Main Fork of the Slamon</em></strong> is the lower section of the Salmon River below the infamous Middle Fork on the Salmon River is historically known as <em>The River of No Return</em>.
                This wild river makes its way through the second-deepest gorge on the continent; only Hells Canyon on the Snake River is deeper. 
                The Salmon's granite-walled canyon is over 1,000 feet deeper than the Grand Canyon. For approximately 180 miles, the Salmon River canyon 
                is more than a mile deep. Another fun fact, the river gradiant is steeper than the Colorado river in the Grand Canyon.</li>
            <li><strong>What about permits?</strong> Yes, they're important, but we don't need no stickin' permit! We're launching with the Forest Service's approvval before the permit season opens.</li>
            <li><strong>Rapid rating</strong> III-IV. We can expect early season snow melt run off at high flow.</li>
            <li><strong>Will there be Tiki Torches?</strong> Yes, they're back by popular demand.</li>
            <li><strong>What do I need to bring?</strong> More details below.</li>

            <p>Note well: This is a bring your own booze trip, with plenty to share.</p>

        <p> A quick search will reveal that a typical 5 day commercial river trip costs $1689.
            Our goal was to keep total cost to around $600 per person, including fuel to and from the river, food, car shuttle, and boat rental.</p>

        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        <p><strong>5 rafts, 1 kayak, and 1 paddle board</strong> to carry us downstream 83 miles to Carrey Creek.
            At high flow there are enough rapids to making this a very exciting trip. The gradient of this river is steep, so it's all downhill towards the Pacific -it's gonna be fast!
            Even at normal flows this section of River is moving quickly, which awlays surprises every boater. There's no flat water.
        <p><strong>Private Trip.</strong>  This is a self guided private trip, which means we get to do everything.  Yep that's right, everything, and we mean everything.
            Sure, and that's what makes a private trip so great. There will be a lots to do every day after the thrills and spills on the river, but with the fast river flow 
            there'll be plenty of time to relax or go for a hike. Then the next day we'll break down camp, load and righ the boats. Rigging the boats can take a bit of time, 
            but once we're rollin', we mean rollin'! There be some pucker-factor moments scouting the major rapids, and there's only one direction to go so we go no matter what.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Shared meals.</strong>  This is an opportunity to show off your best camp cooking skills. Please keep in mind that this group on previous trips has set the bar high. 
            So do your best, and impress us, give us your best outdoor river coocking food.</p>
        <p><strong>River.</strong> The water flow is <strong>not</strong> controlled so water level will fluctuate according to the dictates of nature.
            We've been watching the predictions, snow pack is below normal and the expected flow is normal or below, which means a green-light, we're good, go.
            The water temperature will be cold to cool, this afterall early June, so please plan accordingly.
        <p><strong>Bugs.</strong> Generally not problem on this section of the river due to the early season and flow water.  However, be prepared for a hatch just in case.
        <p><strong>Climate.</strong> Daytime temperatures highs coubld be in the 70's or 80's with lots of sun and nighttime temperatures 50 to 60 degrees. However, typically many 
            early June trips experience high's in the 50's with rain. Yes, ita could even snow, but we don't expect freezing temparatures.
        Based on historical averages, the daytime high temps will be 80-90&#176; (85&#176; mean) and the nighttime low temps will be 55-68&#176; (61&#176; mean).
        When on the river there will be full sun exposure to the sun.
        All things considered, even the experts tell us that this is a great time of year to be on the river!

        <p>Some highlights include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Be Prepared.</strong> This is a river trip into the rugged wilderness. Backcountry travelers must be prepared for varying,
                unpredictable weather conditions and should be aware of potential dangers in this environment.</li>
            <li>All garbage, both organic and inorganic, will be carried out.</li>
            <li>Groovers (toilets) are provided by our group at each campsite. Backcountry regulations require that human waste and toilet paper
                be packed out of the backcountry. In short, we'll all share in the duties of taking care of this nasty little necessity.</li>
            <li>Respect for cultural sites. All natural objects and cultural artifacts are protected and must be left where they're found.</li>

<p><strong><em>9 hours, 378 miles</em></strong> from put-in to take-out. Consequently this labor intensive shuttle is very expensive. Garunteed when you arrive at the take-out and your car is there, and it's in one piece and drivable, you'll agree that it's worth every penny.</p>
